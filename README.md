Questions 3 and 6 are combined in this implementation as separate functions. 
Question 3 uses several predetermined inputs to compute the median including corner cases.
Question 6 uses a user's input to compute both the non-recursive and recursive factorial.
All functions return -1 for invalid input. However, the user input is validated before passed to the factorial functions
